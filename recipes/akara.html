    <h3>Steps</h3>
    Here are the steps for making Akara:
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the beans:
            <ul>
                <li>Soak the beans in water for 10-15 minutes.</li>

                <li>Rub the soaked beans between your palms or pulse briefly in a blender to help loosen the skins.
                </li>

                <li>Rinse and drain several times to remove the skins and leave only the white inner beans.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Blend the beans:
            <ul>
                <li>Add the peeled beans, chopped onions, and peppers to a blender.</li>

                <li>Add just a little water (start with ¼ cup) — the batter should be thick, not watery.</li>

                <li>Blend until smooth and creamy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Season the Batter:
            <ul>
                <li>Pour the blended batter into a bowl.</li>
                <li>
                    Add salt to taste and any optional ingredients (e.g., ground crayfish, seasoning cubes).
                </li>

                <li>Beat the batter with a spoon or whisk for a few minutes to incorporate air — this helps make the
                    akara fluffy.
                </li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the Oil:
            <ul>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or pot over medium heat.</li>

                <li> The oil should be hot but not smoking — test with a tiny drop of batter; it should sizzle and
                    float.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            Fry the Akara:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Scoop the batter with a spoon or your hand and carefully drop small mounds into the oil.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not overcrowd the pan — fry in batches.
                </li>
                <li> Fry until golden brown on all sides (about 2–3 minutes per side).</li>
                <li>Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Serve hot with pap (ogi), custard, bread, or as a snack on its own.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
    </ol>
